# Semi Autonomus Drone Navigation

Introduction
-------------

The simulation process involves creating a virtual environment using Unreal Engine 4.27 and the AirSim plugin, which provides a high-fidelity simulation of drone flight and sensor data collection. The environment includes various types of crops, terrain, and obstacles that the drone must navigate around. The simulation allows for the testing and validation of different drone sensors, including RGB and thermal cameras, LIDAR, and ultrasound sensors.

The simulation allows for testing and validation of drone-related algorithms and techniques, such as object detection, path planning, and data collection. It also enables the development of new features and applications that can be integrated into the drone's hardware and software. Additionally, the use of AI and machine learning algorithms in the simulation can improve the accuracy and efficiency of data collection and analysis.
