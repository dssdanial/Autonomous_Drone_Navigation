# Semi Autonomus Drone Navigation

Introduction
=============

The simulation process involves creating a virtual environment using Unreal Engine 4.27 and the AirSim plugin, which provides a high-fidelity simulation of drone flight and sensor data collection. The environment includes various types of crops, terrain, and obstacles that the drone must navigate around. The simulation allows for the testing and validation of different drone sensors, including RGB and thermal cameras, LIDAR, and ultrasound sensors.

The simulation allows for testing and validation of drone-related algorithms and techniques, such as object detection, path planning, and data collection. It also enables the development of new features and applications that can be integrated into the drone's hardware and software. Additionally, the use of AI and machine learning algorithms in the simulation can improve the accuracy and efficiency of data collection and analysis.

-----
* Unreal Engine 4.27
* AirSim (new version)
* Open CV for Python
* Microsoft visual studio 22
* C++ compiler for VS22
* NET framework for VS22

Installation
=============

* To download the project files, go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HEl6NDDz8kOuERAFpLMrJWBNcjAKZSu_?usp=share_link) and look for a file called "Assignment VR". Inside, you'll find two zip folders and a script called "setting.json".

* The "Drone_VR" folder contains the Unreal Engine environment. Extract it into the ``Documents\Unreal Projects`` directory.

* The "Drone_shell" folder contains the main.cpp and Python scripts. Extract it into the AirSim folder you downloaded. Note that there's already a file named "Drone_shell" inside the AirSim package, so you'll need to replace it with the one from the project files. The program is written in C++, so you'll need to compile it before running it.
