# Semi Autonomus Drone Navigation

Introduction
=============

Agriculture drones have become increasingly popular in recent years, as they offer several benefits over traditional farming methods. For one, they can cover large areas of farmland quickly and efficiently, which can save farmers time and money. Additionally, the data they collect is more accurate and detailed than data collected by humans, which can lead to better decision-making and increased crop yields.\n
Agriculture drones, also known as agricultural unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are small unmanned aerial vehicles that are designed for use in agriculture. These drones are equipped with sensors and cameras that enable them to collect high-resolution data and images of crops, soil, and other farming-related data. The data collected by these drones can then be used by farmers to monitor crop health, detect pests and diseases, analyze soil conditions, and make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other farming practices.\n
Overall, agriculture drones are an exciting new technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way farmers approach agriculture. As technology continues to improve, it is likely that these drones will become even more advanced and widely used in the farming industry.
